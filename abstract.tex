\mypara {Abstract:}
The network edge—spanning CDNs, MEC, and ISP-operated edge platforms—is increasingly expected to support latency-critical services such as distributed AI inference, cloud AR/VR, real-time video analytics, targeted advertising, and large-scale live event distribution. While these applications impose strict end-to-end Service Level Objectives (SLOs), real-world edge deployments frequently violate them due to resource contention, heterogeneous workloads, and the lack of SLO-aware resource management, resulting in severe tail-latency degradation.

Our recent work shows through extensive measurements of commercial edge environments that low median latency alone is insufficient—tail latency dominates user experience and drives SLO violations. SMEC further demonstrates that lightweight, deadline-aware resource management can dramatically improve predictability, achieving over 90\% SLO satisfaction under contention.

Building on these insights, this one-year project proposes a network-agnostic, SLO-aware edge computing framework applicable across CDN, MEC, and ISP edge deployments. The framework generalizes time-budget estimation and deadline-aware scheduling beyond 5G-specific mechanisms and extends support to emerging applications with tighter constraints, including cloud AR/VR and interactive XR offloading. The outcome will be an open-source, deployable prototype that enables ISPs to deliver predictable low-latency edge services without invasive coordination or excessive over-provisioning.
