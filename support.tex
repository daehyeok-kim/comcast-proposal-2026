\section{Project Support Details}
\label{sec:support}

We request \textbf{four NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Server Edition GPUs} to enable both large-scale digital twin simulation and MEC testbed validation.

\mypara{Integrated testbed requirements:} Our research requires tight integration between a 5G SDR testbed and edge GPU servers to validate the digital twin against real-world conditions.
Remote cloud GPUs cannot be integrated with our private 5G testbed due to network latency, security restrictions, and the inability to achieve sub-millisecond timing synchronization required for accurate MEC validation.

\mypara{Dedicated hardware allocation:} The four RTX PRO GPUs will be allocated as two GPUs for digital twin simulation and two GPUs for 5G testbed validation.
The digital twin GPUs will simulate thousands of concurrent inference requests across multiple edge servers.
The testbed GPUs will emulate realistic edge deployments where multiple AI applications compete for GPU resources.
Each RTX PRO GPU provides 48GB memory and dedicated CUDA cores necessary for accelerating Aerial/Sionna wireless modeling, running concurrent neural network workloads, and executing GPU contention models with high fidelity.

\mypara{Infrastructure compatibility:} We have two {Dell PowerEdge R760 servers} with PCIe Gen5 slots, providing full compatibility with NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Server Edition GPUs.
These systems offer sufficient power (1200W per server) and cooling capacity to host all four requested GPUs.
