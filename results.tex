\section{Expected Results and Timeline}
\label{sec:results}

This project will deliver two key outcomes:

\mypara{Open-Source Prototype.}
We will release a deployable prototype implementing network-agnostic time-budget estimation, deadline-aware scheduling for heterogeneous edge resources, and SLO-centric overload control mechanisms.
The release will include comprehensive documentation and performance evaluation tools for deployment on diverse edge platforms including ISP, CDN, and MEC environments.

\mypara{Publication.}
We will publish research findings at top-tier systems and networking conferences such as SIGCOMM or NSDI, demonstrating improved SLO satisfaction and reduced tail latency compared to existing approaches through comprehensive evaluation.

\mypara{Timeline.}
We will execute this project over 12 months:

\begin{packeditemize}
    \item \textbf{Months 1--3:} Design and implement network-agnostic time-budget estimation with prototype edge runtime featuring basic deadline-aware scheduling.

    \item \textbf{Months 4--6:} Extend edge runtime to support heterogeneous CPU and GPU workloads with multi-tenant scheduling policies and conduct initial evaluation.

    \item \textbf{Months 7--9:} Implement overload control mechanisms and integrate all components into a cohesive prototype with comprehensive evaluation.

    \item \textbf{Months 10--12:} Refine prototype, prepare open-source release with documentation, and finalize publications.
\end{packeditemize}
