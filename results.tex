\section{Expected Results and Timeline}
\label{sec:results}

This project will deliver fundamental insights and practical tools that advance predictable MEC systems:

\begin{packeditemize}
    \item A unified digital twin platform integrating wireless dynamics (via Aerial/Sionna) with GPU-aware edge compute modeling, addressing the gap in end-to-end MEC simulation.
    \item Comprehensive analysis of MEC unpredictability root causes, quantifying how wireless variability and GPU contention contribute to deadline violations.
    \item Cross-layer scheduling policies coordinating RAN and edge decisions to improve deadline satisfaction for latency-critical AI workloads.
    \item Open-source release of validated MEC simulation tools, real-world traces, and scheduling implementations for the research community.
    \item Publications at top-tier systems and networking conferences such as SIGCOMM, NSDI, and MobiCom.
\end{packeditemize}

\mypara{Timeline (12 months):}
\begin{packeditemize}
    \item \textbf{Months 1--3:} Develop unified simulation architecture bridging Aerial/Sionna with GPU models. Implement event-driven synchronization and validate basic wireless-compute coupling.
    \item \textbf{Months 4--6:} Build detailed GPU contention models with CUDA primitives and adaptive profiling. Release initial integrated digital twin validated against synthetic workloads.
    \item \textbf{Months 7--9:} Conduct comprehensive validation using our USRP X310-based testbed. Refine models using ground truth measurements and release validated simulation tools.
    \item \textbf{Months 10--12:} Design and evaluate cross-layer scheduling policies. Conduct large-scale studies demonstrating improved predictability and submit results to top venues.
\end{packeditemize}
